## Sort modes

Press `s` to cycle through sort modes:

- **Priority** (default): Waiting > Done > Working > Stale
- **Project**: Group by project name, then by priority within each project
- **Recency**: Most recently updated first
- **Natural**: Original tmux order (by pane creation)

Your sort preference persists in the tmux session.
