# Status popup

When running multiple AI agents in parallel, it's helpful to have a centralized view of what each agent is doing. The status popup provides a TUI for monitoring all active agents across all tmux sessions.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
  <img src="/status-popup.webp" alt="workmux status popup" style="border-radius: 4px;">
</div>

## Setup

Add this binding to your `~/.tmux.conf`:

```bash
bind C-s display-popup -h 15 -w 100 -E "workmux status"
```

Then press `prefix + Ctrl-s` to open the dashboard as an overlay. Feel free to adjust the keybinding and popup dimensions (`-h` and `-w`) as needed.

::: warning Prerequisites
This feature requires [status tracking hooks](/guide/status-tracking) to be configured. Without them, no agents will appear in the popup.

## Keybindings

| Key       | Action                              |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `1`-`9`   | Quick jump to agent (closes popup)  |
| `p`       | Peek at agent (popup stays open)    |
| `s`       | Cycle sort mode                     |
| `i`       | Enter input mode (type to agent)    |
| `Ctrl+u`  | Scroll preview up                   |
| `Ctrl+d`  | Scroll preview down                 |
| `Enter`   | Go to selected agent (closes popup) |
| `j`/`k`   | Navigate up/down                    |
| `q`/`Esc` | Quit                                |

## Live preview

The bottom half of the popup shows a live preview of the selected agent's terminal output. The preview auto-scrolls to show the latest output, but you can scroll through history with `Ctrl+u`/`Ctrl+d`.

## Input mode

Press `i` to enter input mode, which forwards your keystrokes directly to the selected agent's pane. This lets you respond to agent prompts without leaving the status popup. Press `Esc` to exit input mode and return to normal navigation.

## Sort modes

Press `s` to cycle through sort modes:

- **Priority** (default): Waiting > Done > Working > Stale
- **Project**: Group by project name, then by priority within each project
- **Recency**: Most recently updated first
- **Natural**: Original tmux order (by pane creation)

Your sort preference persists in the tmux session.

## Columns

- **#**: Quick jump key (1-9)
- **Project**: Project name (from `__worktrees` path or directory name)
- **Agent**: Worktree/window name
- **Status**: Agent status icon (🤖 working, 💬 waiting, ✅ done, or "stale")
- **Time**: Time since last status change
- **Title**: Claude Code session title (auto-generated summary)
