# Diff view

Press `d` to view the diff for the selected agent. The diff view has two modes:

- **WIP** - Shows uncommitted changes (`git diff HEAD`)
- **review** - Shows all changes on the branch vs main (`git diff main...HEAD`)

Press `Tab` while in diff view to toggle between modes. The footer displays which mode is active along with diff statistics showing lines added (+) and removed (-).

If there are no changes to show, a message is displayed instead:

- WIP mode: "No uncommitted changes"
- Review mode: "No commits on this branch yet"
